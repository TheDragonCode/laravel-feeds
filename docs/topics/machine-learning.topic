    <p>
        You can help your LLM understand the structure and conventions of this project much better.
    </p>

    <p>
        To do that, import the guidance from the following file:
        <a href="https://feeds.dragon-code.pro/llms.txt">
            <format style="bold">llms.txt</format>
        </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This file is a single, consolidated Markdown document containing the compiled documentation for this project. It is designed to be used as a knowledge base for LLMs (for example, as a system prompt attachment, a retrieval corpus, or a custom knowledge file).
    </p>

    <note>
        Save the URL and re-import it periodically to pick up updates as the project evolves.
